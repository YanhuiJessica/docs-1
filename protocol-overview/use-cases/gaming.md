# Gaming

Superfluid allows the movement of in-game value to happen in a more efficient and scalable fashion. Check out this article breaking down its use cases ðŸ‘‡

### Streaming of In-Game Resources

Moving tokenized in-game resources is often done in a gradual fashion rather than in discrete lump-sums. For instance, think about a game such as Clash of Clans, where a player can purchase [Gold Mines and Elixir Collectors](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Resources) which yields them Elixir and Gold in real-time. These resources are then used for other in-game activities.

With Superfluid, in-game resources akin to Elixir and Gold can be streamed to directly players' accounts thereby giving them the immediate ability to utilize them. In a Web3 context, this could be akin to purchasing a Gold Mine NFT that upon purchase, will yield the player a stream of gold tokens. The stream can be increased if the player invests some gold to upgrade the Gold Mine.

### Evolving NFTs

An evolving NFT would change over time as you stream a resource to it. Imagine you're trying to water a flower in one of your games which involves you starting a stream of "water tokens" to a flower. As the stream continues, the flower begins to develop new features and evolve!

Check out PlantyBois, a hackathon project which attempted an NFT collection of this nature ðŸ‘‡

### Guild Membership Models

Guilds have become commonplace in Web3 gaming, especially with so much real value on the line. The financialization of guilds can be seriously enhanced with Superfluid.

For membership, guilds could require an automatic on-chain subscription fee in the form of money streams. This would provide the guild another source of continual revenue.

For guild earnings, they could be scalably distributed out straight to member wallets using the Superfluid Instant Distribution Agreement to all active members. Or, stakes in the guild revenue could be tokenized and sold on the open market (though there may be compliance challenges with that).
