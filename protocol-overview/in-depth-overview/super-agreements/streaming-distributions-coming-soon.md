# ðŸŒŠ Streaming Distributions \[Coming Soon]

The Superfluid Protocol team also has a groundbreaking new agreement that is currently in development: the General Distribution Agreement (GDA). The GDA will enhance the current [Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)](instant-distribution-agreement-ida.md) &[ Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) ](../../../developers/constant-flow-agreement-cfa/)to allow for one-to-many Superfluid streaming distributions, becoming most scalable way to distribute recurring funds to a large set of recipients in web3.

The GDA will allow anyone to create a **pool** and to give units within that pool to any address. These accounts which are given units within the pool will be called **pool members**. This is similar to the IDA's function with indexes & subscribers, with the key difference being that, instead of having a function which distributes tokens in discrete amounts, **pool admins** (the creators of each pool) as well as designated **distributors** (an account which has been given permission to stream to a pool) will be able to start streaming funds to all pool members or update the total amount that is being streamed.

Flow rates for each member will be calculated based on the total proportion of units they hold within the pool, and theyâ€™ll be updated automatically in a single transaction if the pool's flow rate is modified. Hereâ€™s how it will work ðŸ‘‡

1. First, an account (called a `pool admin`) will create a GDA pool which will act as a 'channel' between the distributors of funds & future stream recipients (called `pool members`). The channel can be thought of like â€˜pipingâ€™ that will be used to stream funds to each subscriber every single second.
2. Then, the pool admin can set proportions for various member accounts under the GDA pool. This is done by issuing units to members which work like distribution shares. The more units an account has relative to other receivers, the bigger proportion of the total streaming distribution it will receive.
3. Pool admins can designate distributors who have the ability to create streams to the pool. A distributor is any account who has the permission to create/update/delete streams to the pool (the pool admin is a distributor by default). When a distributor calls `createDistributionFlow()` (function name still TBD), every pool member will start receiving a stream with a flow rate _proportional_ to the amount of units they have over the total outstanding units. Regardless of the amount of recipients, the gas cost paid by the distributor to create/update/delete this flow will remain fixed.

### GDA Basics

This diagram outlines the flow of a standard GDA. A distributor (left) distributes funds to a pool with different units (right) via money streams. Note that creating this stream to`n` members will only take a single transaction.

### Changing Unit Counts

This diagram shows the case where a distributor updates unit counts. This changes the flow rate of every other member instantly - all in a single transaction. Note that you can use batch calls to change large numbers of units in a single transaction.

### Changing the Flow Rate

This final diagram outlines the case where a distributor updates the GDA flow rate. This changes the flow rate of every member instantly - all in a single transaction.
