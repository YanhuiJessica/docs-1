# ðŸŒŠ Streaming Distributions

{% hint style="info" %}
The GDA is live on testnets - relevant addresses can be found on the [Console](https://console.superfluid.finance/eth-goerli/protocol). We are currently working on tooling support (adding to SuperTokenV1Library and SDK Core).
{% endhint %}

The GDA introduces a new primitive which enables one-to-many Superfluid **streaming distributions**, becoming the **most scalable** way to distribute recurring funds to a limitless set of recipients in web3.

The GDA enables anyone to create a **pool** and set a **pool admin** who can assign **units** to **pool members** (must not be another pool). Additionally, any account can be a **distributor** and execute an instant or stream distribution of funds via a pool.

Concepts shared by the GDA and IDA (Instant Distribution Agreement):

* IDA: Index => GDA: Pool
* IDA: Units => GDA: Units
* IDA: Subscriber => GDA: Pool Member
* IDA: Publisher => GDA: Pool Admin / Distributor
  * Note: Anyone can be a distributor in the GDA whereas only the publisher could in the IDA

Key differences in the GDA:

* Streaming distributions: the additional ability to execute a 1-to-many distribution every second
* A pool is a contract vs. in the IDA, index data is state saved on the SuperToken
  * A pool is an ERC20 token
    * Pool members can transfer units (in the IDA, only publisher can modify units)
* Anyone can distribute funds via a pool vs. in the IDA, only the publisher can distribute

Here is a walkthrough of how the GDA works at a high-level:

1. First, any account can create a pool and set the desired pool admin. This pool acts as a 'channel' between distributors and pool members. The channel can be thought of â€˜pipingâ€™ that is used to distribute funds to pool members either instantly or via streaming, every single second.
2. The pool admin of a pool can arbitrarily grant and revoke units to pool members. **Only the pool admin can create or delete units.** The units a pool member owns represents their share of the pool which reflects the proportion of future distributions that they are entitled to.
3. Pool members can also **connect to a pool** (approve subscription in the IDA) or **disconnect from a pool** (delete subscription in the IDA).
   * If a pool member is **disconnected**: distributed funds reside in the pool and require claiming from the pool in order to gain access to using those funds.
   * If a pool member is **connected**: distributed funds are made available immediately upon distribution and can be used instantly.
4. Any account can execute an instant or stream distribution of funds via a pool which is distributed to pool members:
   * Instant Distribution
     * The amount of distribution a user receives via instant distribution is determined by the **Instant Distribution formula**: `distributionAmount * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`
   * Streaming Distribution
     * The amount of distribution a user receives via stream distribution is determined by the **Flow Distribution formula**: `poolFlowRate * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`
   * The gas cost paid by the distributor to execute an instant distribution or create/update/delete a streaming distribution remains fixed regardless of the number of pool members.

### GDA Examples by Illustration

This diagram illustrates a streaming distribution. A distributor (left) stream distributes funds via a pool with different members (right) with different units. Note: executing a streaming distribution to`n` members occurs in a single transaction.

### Changing Unit Counts

This diagram illustrates the case where a distributor updates members' units. This effect changes the flow rate of every other member instantly - all in a single transaction. Note that you can use Superfluid's batch call to update units for many members in a single transaction.

### Changing the Flow Rate

This final diagram outlines the case where a distributor updates their streaming distribution flow rate and thus the total flow rate of the pool. This changes the flow rate of every member instantly - all in a single transaction.

### Superfluid Pool Features

Given that the Superfluid Pool is also an ERC20 token, this enables additional features:

* transfer of owned units (using `transfer`)
* units transfer on your behalf (using `approve` and `transferFrom`)

The modification of units was not possible in the IDA and representing the units as an ERC20 makes it more composable and unlocks an entirely new design space.

### Handling Odd Numbers with the Adjustment Flow Rate

The GDA handles an edge case when there is a remainder in the amount of tokens to be streamed to the pool because solidity does not allow for floating point arithmetic. This is handled with something called the **adjustment flow rate** which is always streamed to the pool admin, and is best explained via an example:

* Alice creates a pool and assigns 3 units each to Bob, Carol and Dave. Alice's pool has 9 total units.&#x20;
* She then does a flow distribution of 100 DAIx/second. The issue here is that 100 / 9 (11.11...) is not fully divisible.&#x20;
* Therefore, an adjustment flow is required. The adjustment flow rate handles the cases where the desired flow rate is not divisible by the total number of units.&#x20;
* In the case of Alice's pool, the flow rate sent to the pool members is 99/s (closest divisible value without remainder, rounding down) and 1/s is the adjustment flow rate.&#x20;

The GDA is currently available on select testnets - see [Contract Addresses](../../../developers/networks.md). We are in the process of solidifying its security and developer experience.
