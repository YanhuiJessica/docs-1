# Super Agreements

## Definition

Super Agreements define ways that Super Token balances can be modified beyond the basic ERC20 functions. They are what make Super Tokens "super"!

When an account engages in a Super Agreement with another account, it agrees to have its Super Token balance modified according to the rules of the Super Agreement and chosen parameters. Currently, there are two available Super Agreements: the **Constant Flow Agreement** and the **Instant Distribution Agreement**.&#x20;

### CFA = Token Streaming
