# Super Apps

## Definition

Super Apps are smart contracts that inherit Superfluid functionality giving them the ability to **react to Super Agreements**. Through callbacks, a Super App can "react" to the creating, updating, and deleting react with customized logic set in its smart contract code.

## **Reacting to Super Agreements**

**Callbacks** are what make Super Apps reactive. They are custom code that a developer can implement in a Super App that triggers when a Super Agreement to the Super App is created, updated, or deleted. This code could enact anything from minting an NFT to initiating a new CFA.&#x20;

### **Example - Stream Consolidator Super App**

A Super App, programmed to take all inbound flows to it and aggregate them into a single outbound flow to the designated Account Z, is deployed.&#x20;

**1.** Account A starts a CFA to the Super App of 100 USDCx/mo. _In reaction_, the Super App initiates an outbound CFA of 100 USDCx/mo. from itself to Account Z.

**2.** Account B starts a CFA to the Super App of 25 USDCx/mo and Account A updates its CFA to 50 USDCx/mo. The Super App reacts with the necessary flow update in its outbound CFA.

**3.** The Super App will continue to react appropriately as new accounts create, update, and delete CFAs to the Super App.&#x20;

**NOTE**: While any smart contract can engage Super Agreements, a smart contract must have callbacks defined in order to be classified as a Super App.

## Why Are Super Apps Needed?

The Super Agreement reactivity and management properties of Super Apps create an intermediate layer of programmability to Super Agreement's that would not be possible with just wallet-to-wallet engagement.

As a result, applications can be made that mesh together custom logic with Super Agreements to create scalable dApps with innovative user experiences.&#x20;

For instance, a developer may create a lending Super App where loan repayment can be done via CFA stream rather than manual and repetitive repayment transactions. Or consider a Super App supporting on-chain subscriptions paid via CFA stream with a built-in affiliate program that automatically redirects portions of subscription streams to referrers. The possibilities with Super Apps are endless.
