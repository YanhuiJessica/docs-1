## What is Superfluid?

Superfluid is a smart contract framework that adds new ways to move digital value to the traditional ERC20 token standard we know and love.&#x20;

Superfluid consists of 4 main components: Super Tokens, Super Agreements, Super Apps, and the Superfluid Host. Read this overview to understand the "what" and the "how" behind these components and how they interrelate.

## Contents

First, learn about these Superfluid-enabled tokens which are the base of the Superfluid Protocol

[super-tokens.md](super-tokens.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then, understand these Super Agreement features we've made which give Super Tokens cool untraditional value transfer methods (like money streaming!)

{% content-ref url="super-agreements/" %}
[super-agreements](super-agreements/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Next, learn about Super Apps which are smart contracts that can respond to Super Agreements with custom logic.

{% content-ref url="super-apps.md" %}
[super-apps.md](super-apps.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

And finally, get to know what brings all these parts together - the Superfluid Host.
