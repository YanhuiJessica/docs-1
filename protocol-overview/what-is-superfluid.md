# ðŸ’¡ What is Superfluid?

## Token-Centric Framework

Superfluid is an token-centric smart EVM contract framework that introduces the **Super Token**. The Super Token is an extension of the ERC20 standard that has additional powerful value-movement abilities beyond the basic "transfer". We call these abilities Super Agreements.

Currently there are two additional Super Agreements:

****:potable\_water:  **"Money Streams" - Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)**: move tokens in constant-rate by-the-second streams between accounts with no capital lock up.

****:eight\_spoked\_asterisk: **"Instant Distributions" - Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)**: assign proportions to many receiving accounts and lump-distribute tokens to them on the basis of the set proportions

These agreements modify the balance of Super Tokens just like basic transfers would! There's no claiming/settling/etc. involved - Superfluid instantly settles everything within the Super Token balance.

## Composable

ERC20 tokens are the most composable Web3 primitive - you can borrow against them, exchange them, stake them, the list is endless. Since all Superfluid boils down to is an extended ERC20 token, its composability is limitless as well.&#x20;

You can do all those basic ERC20 things in addition to the many possibilities introduced by money streams and instant distributions. Imagine a contract where you stake an NFT and receive a stream of Super Tokens straight to your wallet in return (no need to claim). Or, imagine a dollar-cost averaging protocol that scalably distributes Super Tokens straight to investor wallets with a fixed gas cost.&#x20;

Unprecendented mechanisms like this are made possible by the composability of Super Tokens.&#x20;
