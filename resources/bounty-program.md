# üí∞ Bounty Program

The Superfluid Bounty Program allows developers to tackle a variety of technical issues laid out by the Superfluid Team and earn payouts for completion. Ready to get bounty hunting? Let's get started!

### Bounties üí∞

Pick a bounty issue you would like to complete in our repo [**HERE**](https://github.com/orgs/superfluid-finance/projects/17/). They range in skill utilization (Solidity, Node.js, DevOps, etc.) and size.

Featured bounties üí°:

* **Superfluid Gitcoin Aquaduct**: Adding Superfluid streams as a method of payment within Gitcoin Aqueducts
* **SuperPool**: A generic smart contract pool that allows deposits and withdrawals via stream

**Referrals**

If you find someone to complete a bounty, you can earn **20%** of the bounty value as a referral payout!&#x20;

1. When the person you referred completes the bounty, let us know in the #üí∞bounties channel that you referred that person.&#x20;
2. We will verify with the bounty completer that you did in fact refer that person&#x20;
3. If that looks good, we'll give you the green light to follow steps 2 and 3 in "Upon Completion" below to earn your payout. \
   \- In the "Your Hack Name" field, you'd write " \[Bounty Completor Discord or Github handle] referral ".
