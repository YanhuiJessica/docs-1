# üèÉ‚ôÄ Quickstart

## Money Streaming

The Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) allows for money streaming. Read this [short explainer](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/in-depth-overview/super-agreements/constant-flow-agreement-cfa) on how it works and then find the resources you need below!

### Using Money Streaming in Your Frontend

You want to let users manage their streams from your frontend.

* [**Initializing**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/sdk-core-initialization#infura-provider-initialization): How to initialize our Javascript SDK (the SDK Core) for your frontend to start conveniently accessing Superfluid functionality
* [**Money Streaming Functions**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/cfa-operations): See the functions that allow you to manage streams using the SDK Core.&#x20;
* ****[**Simple Example**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/interactive-tutorials/money-streaming-1): Very simple ReactJS examples showing how to allow a user to create, update, and delete their streams.

### Using Money Streaming in Smart Contracts

You want to create a smart contract that engages streams on its own.

* [**Contract Set Up**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/solidity-libraries/cfav1-library#the-cfa-library): Set up your smart contract with the Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) library to easily start money streams in Solidity.
* [**Money Streaming Functions**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/solidity-libraries/cfav1-library#using-the-cfa-library): See the basic flow management functions of the CFA Library
* [**ACL Usage**:](constant-flow-agreement-cfa/cfa-access-control-list-acl/) See how you can provide other addresses with the ability to create, update, and delete streams on your behalf
* ****[**Simple Example**](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/main/examples/money-streaming-intro): "Money Router" smart contract example showing the very basics of coding stream management into a smart contract
* [**Video Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU): Tutorial demonstrating coding the Money Router contract

### Testing With Money Streams

You want to work with streaming in your test scripts.

* [**Initializing**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/sdk-core-initialization#hardhat-signer-example) **** (Hardhat): How to initialize our Javascript SDK (the SDK Core) for your Hardhat testing script to start conveniently accessing Superfluid functionality.
* [**Money Streaming Functions**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/cfa-operations): See the functions that allow you to manage streams using the SDK Core.
* [**Simple Example**](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/main/examples/tradeable-cashflow): Our "Tradeable Cashflow" example project Hardhat test script shows a lot of the basics.

## Instant Distributions

The Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) allows for one-to-many instant distributions. Read this [short explainer](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/in-depth-overview/super-agreements/instant-distribution-agreement-ida) on how it works and then find the resources you need below!

### Using Instant Distributions On Your Frontend

You want to let users to manage their instant distribution indices from your frontend.

* [**Initializing**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/sdk-core-initialization#infura-provider-initialization): How to initialize our Javascript SDK (the SDK Core) for your frontend to start conveniently accessing Superfluid functionality
* [**Instant Distribution Functions**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-initialization/sdk-core/ida-operations): See the functions that allow you to manage streams using the SDK Core.
* ****[**Simple Example**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/interactive-tutorials/instant-distribution): Very simple ReactJS examples showing how to allow a user to create and manage an Instant Distribution Agreement Index.

### Using Instant Distributions in Smart Contracts

You want to create a smart contract that does instant distributions on its own.

* ****[**Contract Set Up**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/solidity-libraries/idav1-library#importing-and-initialization): Set up your smart contract with the Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) library to easily start instant distributions in Solidity.
* ****[**Instant Distribution Functions**](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/solidity-libraries/idav1-library#api-specification): See the basic IDA management functions of the IDA Library
* ****[**Simple Example**](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/main/examples/instant-distribution-intro): "Token Spreader" smart contract example showing the very basics of coding IDA management into a smart contract
* ****[**Written Tutorial**](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/main/examples/instant-distribution-intro#ida-tutorial): Tutorial demonstrating coding the Token Spreader contract
