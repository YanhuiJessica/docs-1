# Wrapper Super Tokens

### What are Wrapper Super Tokens?

Wrapper Super Tokens are the most common Super Tokens. They are deployed whenever an ERC20 token already exists to create an equivalent Super Token version that has Super Agreement capabilities - like money streaming!

Anyone can permissionlessly create a wrapper for any existing ERC20 token. Wrappers for many popular tokens like DAI, USDC, and WETH have been deployed on the various chains we support. Check out the[ Network Directory](../../../networks/) for the full list.

For some more on the basics of Wrapper Super Tokens, refer back to our [overview explainer](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/in-depth-overview/super-tokens#wrapper).
