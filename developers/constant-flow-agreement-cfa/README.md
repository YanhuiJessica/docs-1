# ðŸŒŠ Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)

## What is the CFA?

The Constant Flow Agreement lets you stream money! What do we mean by streaming? Streaming is a constant by-the-second movement of tokens from a sending account to a receiving account. In a CFA, the sender agrees to have its account balance reduce at a certain per-second rateâ€”called the flow rateâ€”and the receiving party's account balance increase at that flow rate.&#x20;

A stream is perpetual and will continue until the sender decides to cancel it or the sender's Super Token balance hits zero. It can also be created, updated, or deleted whenever the sender wants.

**This section will show you how to develop code that interacts with the CFA. For something more conceptual, check out this simple conceptual breakdown** ðŸ‘‡
