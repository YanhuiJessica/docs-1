# SDK Core General

The Superfluid SDK-Core is a wrapper library around `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts` which allows web developers to interact with the Superfluid contracts. Under the hood, SDK-Core leverages TypeScript, ethers.js and The Graph and GraphQL.

The following pages in this section provide an overview on how to use the SDK core to interact with the protocol and the Interactive Tutorials section will give you live code examples you can use in your own projects. If you're looking for more depth, you can find the reference docs for the SDK Core here:
