# ðŸ§º Batch Calls

The Batch Call feature allows you to perform multiple steps in a single transaction, including calls for Super Tokens, Super Apps, and both at the same time.

The primary goal of the Batch Call is to provide you (and your users) with an easy on/off-ramp to your Super App. It allows smooth user-experiences, without spending precious resources on solidity research and engineering for ad-hoc multi-step transactions.

Instead, you can focus on writing your Super App quickly and intuitively. Once you're satisfied with the basic functionality, it's only a matter of "wrapping up" functions into a Batch Call.
