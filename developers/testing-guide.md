description: How to deploy the framework locally for testing in Foundry & Hardhat
---

# Testing Guide

Testing is a critical component of building any piece of software. When testing locally with Superfluid, youâ€™ll need to deploy the framework first before running your tests. Below, youâ€™ll find examples on how to do this in common web3 development environments. No matter what environment you choose to use, setting up a test suite for a Superfluid project has two components:

1. Deploying the framework
2. Minting fake super tokens to use within your tests

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ’¡ These examples reference the MoneyRouter contract which is covered in detail in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU\&t=244s) on money streaming in solidity.

### Video Tutorial

For the visually inclined, we also have a video on this topic.

### Hardhat Example

We recommend including the following imports and deployment scripts when setting up your hardhat tests. The `deployTestFramework()` script will allow you to deploy the framework using the [SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol) contract, and to call `deploySuperTokenWrapper()` to mint fake Super Tokens for your tests.

Dependencies you'll need are listed at the top of the file, but if you already have a hardhat project set up, you'll likely only need `@superfluid-finance/sdk-core` and `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts`.

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { Framework } = require("@superfluid-finance/sdk-core");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const deployTestFramework = require("@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/scripts/deploy-test-framework");
const TestToken = require("@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/build/contracts/TestToken.json");

let sfDeployer;
let contractsFramework;
let sf;
let moneyRouter;
let dai;
let daix;

// Test Accounts
let owner;
let account1;
let account2;

// Constants
//for usage in IDA projects
const expecationDiffLimit = 10; // sometimes the IDA distributes a little less wei than expected. Accounting for potential discrepency with 10 wei margin
//useful for denominating large units of tokens when minting
const thousandEther = ethers.utils.parseEther("10000");

before(async function () {
    // get hardhat accounts
    [owner, account1, account2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    sfDeployer = await deployTestFramework();

    // GETTING SUPERFLUID FRAMEWORK SET UP

    // deploy the framework locally
    contractsFramework = await sfDeployer.getFramework();

    // initialize framework
    sf = await Framework.create({
        chainId: 31337,
        provider: owner.provider,
        resolverAddress: contractsFramework.resolver,
        protocolReleaseVersion: "test"
    });

    // DEPLOYING DAI and DAI wrapper super token
    tokenDeployment = await sfDeployer.deployWrapperSuperToken(
        "Fake DAI Token",
        "fDAI",
        18,
        ethers.utils.parseEther("100000000").toString()
    );

    daix = await sf.loadSuperToken("fDAIx");
    dai = new ethers.Contract(daix.underlyingToken.address, TestToken.abi, owner);
    

    // minting and wrapping test DAI to all accounts
    await dai.mint(owner.address, thousandEther);
    await dai.mint(account1.address, thousandEther);
    await dai.mint(account2.address, thousandEther);

    // approving DAIx to spend DAI (Super Token object is not an ethers contract object and has different operation syntax)
    await dai.approve(daix.address, ethers.constants.MaxInt256);
    await dai.connect(account1).approve(daix.address, ethers.constants.MaxInt256);
    await dai.connect(account2).approve(daix.address, ethers.constants.MaxInt256);
    // Upgrading all DAI to DAIx
    const ownerUpgrade = daix.upgrade({amount: thousandEther});
    const account1Upgrade = daix.upgrade({amount: thousandEther});
    const account2Upgrade = daix.upgrade({amount: thousandEther});

    await ownerUpgrade.exec(owner);
    await account1Upgrade.exec(account1);
    await account2Upgrade.exec(account2);

    //DEPLOY YOUR CONTRACT 
    //you can find this example at https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/main/projects/money-streaming-intro/test
    let MoneyRouter = await ethers.getContractFactory("MoneyRouter", owner);
    moneyRouter = await MoneyRouter.deploy(
        sf.settings.config.cfaV1ForwarderAddress,
        owner.address
    );
    await moneyRouter.deployed();
});

//Write your tests...
```

### Foundry Example

Within a foundry test file, you can call the SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer contract directly in your `setUp()` function.

```solidity
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../../contracts/MoneyRouter.sol";
import {ISuperfluid} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";

import {
    SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer,
    TestGovernance,
    Superfluid,
    ConstantFlowAgreementV1,
    CFAv1Library,
    SuperTokenFactory
} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol";

contract StreamRebounderRandomTest is Test {

    StreamRebounder public streamRebounder;
    
    struct Framework {
        TestGovernance governance;
        Superfluid host;
        ConstantFlowAgreementV1 cfa;
        CFAv1Library.InitData cfaLib;
        InstantDistributionAgreementV1 ida;
        IDAv1Library.InitData idaLib;
        SuperTokenFactory superTokenFactory;
    }

    SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.Framework sf;
    
    function setUp() public {
				
	address public owner;
	//DEPLOYING THE FRAMEWORK
        SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer sfDeployer = new SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer();
        sf = sfDeployer.getFramework();
				
	// DEPLOYING DAI and DAI wrapper super token

	vm.prank(owner);
	ISuperToken daix = sfDeployer.deployWrapperToken(
	    "Fake DAI", "DAI", 18, 10000000000000
	);
	
        MoneyRouter = new StreamRebounder(
            sf.host,
            owner
        );
    }

    //add other functions and test contracts...

}
```

When using foundry, you'll need to install `superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts`. If you have issues when running `forge install`, try using the `--no-commit` flag.

### But what about truffle/brownie/other environment?

We have a legacy truffle example that you can find [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/chainshot/examples/archive/tradeable-cashflow-truffle/test/TradeableCashflow.test.js). It is very similar to the Hardhat example above, but with some minor differences in terms of imports & scripts used for framework deployment.

A brownie/python example is in the works. Stay tuned (:
