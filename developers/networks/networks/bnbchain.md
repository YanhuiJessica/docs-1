# BNB Chain

To use Superfluid with the BNB Chain, you'll need a RPC URL to connect your Metamask or application to a BNB Chain node.

To add BNB Chain to Metamask, you can head to your Settings in Metamask, and select Networks. Click 'Add Network,' and enter an BNB Chain RPC URL such as [https://bscrpc.com](https://bscrpc.com)
