# ðŸ¤– Super Apps

## What are Super Apps?

Super Apps are smart contracts that are registered with the Superfluid Protocol allowing them to **react to Super Agreements**. Through callbacks, a Super App can "react" to the creating, updating, and deleting of Super Agreements that it's been engaged with by means of customized logic set in its smart contract code.
