# Testing Guide

Learn how to **deploy the Superfluid Framework locally** and **mint fake Super Tokens** to get set with your testing.

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ’¡ These examples reference the MoneyRouter contract which is covered in detail in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU\&t=244s) on money streaming in solidity.
{% endhint %}

#### But what about truffle/brownie/other environments?

We have a legacy truffle example that you can find [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/chainshot/examples/archive/tradeable-cashflow-truffle/test/TradeableCashflow.test.js). It is very similar to the Hardhat example above, but with some minor differences in terms of imports & scripts used for framework deployment.

A brownie/python example is in the works. Stay tuned (:
